For my final project, I plan to recreate the game from 2014 called Flappy Bird. I have experience with Cinder through the Ideal Gas MP and have played different variations of Flappy Bird in the past, so I know that this is possible. If it's good enough, I plan to market the app.

By the end of week 1, I will have created the base Gui with the bird, barrel obstacles, and allow for user interaction. By week 2, I will have programmed features for barrel movement as shown in the game. By the end of week 3, I will have created other obstacles like planes that the bird has to dodge.

If I am to finish the project early, I will add coins to increase the players' scores.
